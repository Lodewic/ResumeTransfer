\section{Master Thesis}

\cvitem{title}{The erroneous use of the Haar wavelet for stock price prediction}
\cvitem{supervisor}{Prof. Dr. Marcel Worring}
\cvitem{description}{A critical analysis and replication of a well-cited research paper proposing a combination of wavelet transformation and recurrent neural networks for successful stock prediction. Wavelet transformations can be used in time-series analysis to reduce the noise of the signal, or stock prices specifically. Our research criticizes the use of the Haar wavelet by showing that it is both impossible to use in real-time and the sole reason for the reportedly profitable, yet false, 'predictions' shown by Hsieh et al. [2011]. This error was potentially reproduced in more recent research}
